i think the most important things are to learn console and git, never copy paste tutorial code but type it, do courses where you get projects not just code along stuff..

and if you dont understand any part in a tutorial code just take a break instead of moving on to the next one

its much easier if you think through the logic first, step by step, then just code it :smile:
if you know the logic behind the steps it wont really matter what programming language are u using to code it
if you get it in python it will be piece of cake with javascript or ruby for example
actually in all of my projects (except manta :slightly_smiling_face: ) algorithm planning always took longer than actually coding it
